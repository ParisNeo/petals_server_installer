This installation script is designed to set up a development environment on a Windows System for Linux, specifically targeting Ubuntu-based distributions for use with petals server. The script performs a series of tasks, including package updates, Python installation, Miniconda installation, CUDA setup, and the installation of specific Python packages. Let's break down the procedure step by step:

Update and Upgrade Packages:

The script begins by updating the package repository information using sudo apt update.
It then upgrades all installed packages to their latest versions using sudo apt upgrade -y.
Add a Repository for Python 3.10:

The script adds a third-party repository for Python 3.10 using sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa -y.
After adding the repository, it updates the package information again using sudo apt update.
Install Python 3.10 and Pip:

Python 3.10 and Pip are installed using sudo apt install python3.10 python3-pip -y.
Create Symbolic Links for Python and Pip:

Symbolic links are created for Python 3.10 and Pip to make them available as python and pip commands in /usr/local/bin using sudo ln -s.
Install Miniconda:

Miniconda is downloaded from the official Anaconda repository using wget.
The installer script is executed using bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p ~/miniconda.
The downloaded installer script is removed using rm.
The Miniconda environment is sourced into the current shell session, and this setting is made permanent by appending it to ~/.bashrc.
Create and Activate Conda Environment:

A Conda environment named "petals" is created with Python 3.10 and Pip using conda create.
The newly created Conda environment is activated using conda activate.
Install CUDA:

The script downloads a PIN file to set preferences for the CUDA repository.
It fetches the GPG key for the NVIDIA CUDA repository.
The CUDA repository is added to the package sources.
CUDA is installed using sudo apt-get install cuda.
The PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables are updated to include CUDA binaries and libraries, respectively, and these changes are made permanent by appending them to ~/.bashrc.
Install Petals:

Petals, a Python package, is installed from a specific GitHub repository using pip install.
Install PyQt5:

PyQt5, a Python binding for Qt GUI framework, is installed using pip install PyQt5.
Exit WSL:

The script exits the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment.
This script automates the installation of various tools and packages required fo
